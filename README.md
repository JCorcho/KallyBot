# KallyBot

KallyBot is a simple good-bot helper made for assisting in learning Korean

## Description

KallyBot was birthed as project made to demonstrate the basics of making a Discord bot, using HTTP services and GCloud
development tools. I found very litle information on programming Discord bots in GoLang thus I made a tutorial to help
get people started -> [youtube video link]. After development of the bot a few language learning servers adopted the bot
so now it has a few practical use case examples.

## Getting Started

If you would like to add Kally to your server simply copy and paste the following OAuth link into your browser. Let it
be noted you will need Administrator privileges to any server you would like to add Kally
to. https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=856438324927397919&scope=bot&permissions=3072

### Dependencies

### Installing

## Help

* Simply use the command !kally followed by the text you would like to translate to korean.
