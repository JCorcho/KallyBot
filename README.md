## Description

KallyBot was birthed as project made to demonstrate the basics of making a Discord bot, using HTTP services and GCloud
development tools. I found very little information on programming Discord bots in GoLang thus I am making a tutorial to help
get people started -> [coming soon]. After development of the bot a few language learning discord servers adopted the bot
so now it has a few practical use case examples.

## Getting Started

be noted you will need Administrator privileges to any server you would like to add Kally
to. https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=856438324927397919&scope=bot&permissions=3072
